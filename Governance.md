# Portier Open Source Project Governance

As discussed in [Issue #3](https://github.com/portier/portier.github.io/issues/3), Portier's governance structure is modeled after [AMP](https://github.com/ampproject/amphtml/blob/master/GOVERNANCE.md)'s. It is as follows:

* There is a single Tech Lead, who will have the final say on all decisions regarding technical direction.
* The Tech Lead directs the Core Committers, whose members include the Tech Lead and those who have been appointed by the Tech Lead as Core Committers.
* In the event the Tech Lead is unable to perform his or her duties, or abdicates, the Core Committers can select a new Tech Lead from amongst themselves.

## Core Committers:

* Tech Lead: Dan Callahan ([Keybase](https://keybase.io/callahad))
* David Kitchen ([Keybase](https://keybase.io/buro9))
* Dirkjan Ochtman ([Keybase](https://keybase.io/djc))
* Malte Paskuda ([Keybase](https://keybase.io/onli))
* Stavros Korokithakis ([Keybase](https://keybase.io/stavros))
